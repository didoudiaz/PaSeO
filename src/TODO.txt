How to handle mutiple models for a same problem ?

link options to associated solver (ex: -aspiration-factor to ROTS). What if related to several solvers ?
display after each problem the expected argument. Modify help to group by solvers

pass solverNo to SolverState to be recorded in the EP (and more keep trace of all changes). Use a chain of SolverState ?

version number (put it in manifest.mf) ?

change representation vec and matrix by objects

ILS: dont'look bits ? is it useful ?

ModelQAP: replace Move by PermutationMove in methods (ex: doMove) to avoid casts:
pb: remove Override and need to implement a method for the interface (add an default implem, insert
an intermediate class AbstractPermutationMove between AbstractModel and ModelQAP ?...)
